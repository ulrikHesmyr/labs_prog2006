# guido

This is what Guido did. He used Floats to represent the txs and fees and earnings.
His calculations were way OFF the correct values. Don Corleone KNEW the correct values,
and he did not buy Guido explanations about Floating point numbers represented in computers,
rounding errors, and all that bullshit.  Guido was killed...

Do not be Guido.  Never use floats or doubles or any other floating point representation for Currency or Money...


To run:

```bash
stack run < ../txs.txt
